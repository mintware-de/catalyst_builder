## 3.5.0

Updated the version constraint of the analyzer package.

## 3.4.0

Features:
- Added an example for working with relative dependencies. [PR#19](https://github.com/mintware-de/catalyst_builder/pull/19)

Changes:
- The preflight builder will no more emit empty files. This should increase the build performance. [PR#18](https://github.com/mintware-de/catalyst_builder/pull/18)

## 3.3.1

Fixes:
- Fixed the enhance method. [PR#16](https://github.com/mintware-de/catalyst_builder/pull/16)

## 3.3.0

Features:
- Added stricter rules to analysis_options.yaml
  - Added type castings to the generated service provider.

## 3.2.3

Fixes:
- Fixed the enhance method and overtake the expose map and the known services map.

## 3.2.2

Fixes:
- Fixed the type inference when enhancing the ServiceProvider.

## 3.2.1

Fixes:
- Fixed the generation for libraries (working with `part` and `part of`).
- Fixed the extraction of services for packages without the `GenerateServiceProvider` annotation.

## 3.2.0

Features:
- Introducing the new `@Inject` annotation. This annotation works like the `@Parameter` Annotation but is more flexible.
  You can use it to inject a list of tagged services and also to inject parameters. The example code contains a
  example for this feature.

Deprecations:
- The `@Parameter` annotation was marked as deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.  
  See [UPGRADE.md](UPGRADE.md) for upgrade instructions.

Changes:
- Updated the minimum `analyzer` version to `^5.0.0`

Internal:
- Updated the usages of deprecated properties. Using
  - `element` instead of `element2`
  - `enclosingElement` instead of `enclosingElement3`
- Preflight logic refactored

## 3.1.0

Maintenance Release

- Replaced a deprecated function call (assignVar)

## 3.0.0

Features:
- Added the `GenerateServiceProvider` annotation

Changes:
- Updated the minimum Dart SDK version to `2.17.0`

Breaking Changes:

    This change was necessary since the build_runner does not recognize changes correctly with runtime file names.
  - Removed the option `preflightExtension`.

  - `implementation_imports`
  - `no_leading_underscores_for_library_prefixes`

## 2.3.0
